We building a website that will be really helpful for a college fresher. A fresher is often unaware and unprepared for the change in reality that they'd encounter by the first year of their college itself. As a second yr student, we had always wished if someone would have given us honest feedbacks of a lot of things that are often neglected and often advertised in the most enticing way possible, keeping their new potential crowd focused on the opportunities offered by the college, than the ones which can be missed. Our website ensures that everything is transparent for the freshers as well as the parents. From college tuition quality to hostel life truths. From mess food quality to classroom quality. From college crowd to professors. Every information that is necessary for a fresher to know, shall be made available by the current students pursuing their degree in their respective college. Our website collects relevant feedback from the users who have registered from their respective college. We would ensure that feedback is relevant and doesn't have any vulgar content in it, if found, we shall make sure to delete it. 

Our mission is simpleâ€”empower freshers with the truth about their college experience before they even step in. Through a platform built by students, for students, we aim to foster a more informed and prepared generation of college-goers. Transparency, honesty, and relevance are at the core of what we do, ensuring that no fresher has to walk into college unaware.
